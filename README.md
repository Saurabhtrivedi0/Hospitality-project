## Project: Hospitality Analytics Dashboard | AtliQ Grands (Power BI)
### Project Overview
AtliQ Grands is a five-star hotel chain operating across major Indian cities. Facing declining revenue and market share due to rising competition and poor data-driven decisions, they decided to adopt business intelligence practices.
### What I Did
	• Created business-relevant KPIs from raw data
	• Designed a Power BI dashboard based on stakeholder mock-up
	• Delivered insights beyond the original brief, focused on city-wise, platform-wise, and temporal performance trends
	• Identified improvement areas in realization %, occupancy patterns, and cancellation rates
### Key Findings
	• Mumbai leads in revenue but lags behind Delhi in occupancy
	• High cancellation rate (25%) consistently across cities
  • ADR remains static despite fluctuations in occupancy and RevPAR—indicating a fixed pricing strategy that may be leaving revenue on the table
	• Weekends outperform weekdays in RevPAR and occupancy—pricing strategy could be adjusted
### Tools & Skills Used
	• Power BI (Modeling, DAX, Visuals)
	• Data cleaning & transformation
	• Hospitality domain understanding
	• Dashboard storytelling focused on business decisions
### Outcome
The dashboard delivered a clear, decision-focused view of hotel performance across cities, platforms, and timelines—helping leadership identify what’s working, what’s not, and where to act.
